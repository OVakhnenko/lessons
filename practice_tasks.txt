1. Create the console app that sorts the array [7,3,9,2,5,1,6,0,6,3]. Which one algorithm of sorting to use is up to you (don't use Arrays.sort() / Collections.sort() ). The console app starts with printing in the terminal the unsorted array. After pressing ENTER the sorted array has to be printed. If you have some inspiration you could make reading unsorted / writing sorted array from/into a file. For instance the app starts with the  reading the input array from some file. After sorting it write sorted array into another file.



2. Write a console application that takes a string and returns the number of unique characters in the string. It is expected that a string with the same character sequence may be passed several times to the method. Since the counting operation can be time consuming, the method should cache the results, so that when the method is given a string previously encountered, it will simply retrieve the stored result. Use collections and maps where appropriate.
