Migrate the Departments project from Console app to Web app. The web app does the same that console app do but it renders the html pages that displays the departments/employees list and allows to perform CRUD operations with them. Watch mockups for details.

Requirements:

1. Create web project structure with maven (https://maven.apache.org/plugins-archives/maven-archetype-plugin-1.0-alpha-7/examples/webapp.html)
2. Use servlets as a containers for business logic for application (java code for working with departments/employees)
3. Use jsp files for displaying the html user interface
4. Use Apache Tomcat as a servlet container and server to run the application
